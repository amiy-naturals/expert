## Verification Workflow

### User Uploads Avatar
1. User goes to Dashboard → Profile → Change Photo
2. Selects JPG, JPEG, PNG, or WebP image
3. Client validates format and size (max 10MB)
4. Image automatically compressed and resized
5. Stored in Supabase Storage
6. Status: `avatar_approved = false` (pending)

### Admin Approves Avatar
1. Admin goes to Admin → Users
2. Finds user with `Avatar: Pending` badge
3. Clicks "View Avatar" to preview
4. Clicks "Approve Avatar" button
5. Status updated: `avatar_approved = true`

### User Submits Doctor Application
1. User goes to /doctor-application
2. Enters medical license number
3. Uploads PDF license file
4. Uploads professional photo (auto-compressed)
5. Submits application
6. Status: `license_verified = false` (pending)

### Admin Verifies License
1. Admin goes to Admin → Users
2. Finds user with license file
3. Clicks "View License" to review PDF
4. Clicks "Verify License" button
5. Status updated: `license_verified = true`

### User Becomes Doctor
Once both conditions are met:
- ✓ `avatar_approved = true`
- ✓ `license_verified = true`

User can:
- Post reviews and consultations
- Be referenced as expert on platform
- Access doctor-only features and commissions

## Database Fields

- license_number: text (existing)
- license_url: text (existing)
- photo_url: text (existing - maps to avatar)
- role: text (existing - values: user, admin, super_admin)
```

## Testing

### To Test Avatar Upload
1. Go to Dashboard → Profile
2. Click "Change Photo"
3. Try uploading: JPG, PNG, WebP (should work)
4. Try uploading: GIF, BMP (should fail with format error)
5. Try uploading: File > 10MB (should fail with size error)

### To Test License Upload
1. Go to /doctor-application
2. Try uploading: PDF file (should work)
3. Try uploading: Word doc, text file (should fail)
4. Try uploading: PDF > 20MB (should fail with size error)

### To Test Admin Approval
1. Log in as admin user
2. Go to Admin → Users
3. Find user with pending avatar
4. Click "Approve Avatar"
5. User status should update

### To Test Super Admin Creation
1. Log in as super_admin user
2. Go to Admin → Super Admin
3. Enter email for new admin
4. Click "Create Super Admin"
5. New super_admin can now log in

## Performance Optimizations

- Image compression reduces file sizes by ~80%
- Automatic resizing prevents oversized uploads
- Client-side validation before upload
- Signed URL access to files (not direct database access)
- Direct upload to Supabase (server doesn't proxy files)

## Backward Compatibility

✓ All existing endpoints still work
✓ No breaking changes to API
✓ New fields are optional
✓ Old avatars continue to work
✓ Verification is additive, not required

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future:
- Batch admin approval for multiple users
- Automated license verification via API
- Image auto-crop to square
- Video message approval for doctors
- Doctor verification badge display
- Verification timeline/history logging
- Email notifications when approved/rejected
